This is a website for the Finnish non-profit amateur baseball team Turku Black Sox. It serves as a learning project, and as an example on how an Eleventy page can be built and served from a GitHub repo to GitHub Pages. Since June 2022 the site content is also pulled from Contentful, and a webhook builds the static site via GitHub Actions everytime something is published in Contentful.

The following instructions expect that you have some experience of using [Node.js, npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and a terminal of your choice.

In terminal:

2. Use the command `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use the command `npm run serve` to run the site locally
