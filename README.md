This is a website for the Finnish non-profit amateur baseball team Turku Black Sox. It serves as a learning project, and as an example on how an Eleventy page can be built and served from a GitHub repo to GitHub Pages. Since June 2022 the site content is also pulled from Contentful, and a webhook builds the static site via GitHub Actions everytime something is published in Contentful.
